# üñ®Ô∏è Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in C#

## üìñ Overview

Principle: ISP, an essential principle in SOLID, advocates that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Goal: Promote the creation of narrowly scoped interfaces that are tailored to the needs of individual clients.

## üß© Implementation in Code

### Problematic Bulky Interface:

- Initially, a bulky interface that violates ISP.
  // Bulky interface example that includes too many responsibilities
  public interface IModernMachine {

  // Methods for printing, scanning, faxing
  // Violates ISP as it forces implementation of all methods

  void Print(Document d);
  void Scan(Document d);
  void Fax(Document d);
  }

### Segregated Interfaces (ISP Compliant):

Smaller interfaces focused on specific functionalities.

- // Focused interface for printing
  public interface IPrint {
  void Print(Document d); // Method to print a document
  }

- // Focused interface for scanning
  public interface IScan {
  void Scan(Document d); // Method to scan a document
  }

- // Focused interface for faxing
  public interface IFax {
  void Fax(Document d); // Method to fax a document
  }

- // Combined interface for modern machines
  public interface IModernMachineV2 : IPrint, IScan, IFax {
  // Additional methods op properties that doesn't vary between modern machines
  // Complies with ISP by segregating responsibilities
  }

### Comments on Compliance with ISP:

- The refactored interfaces demonstrate adherence to ISP by ensuring that classes implementing these interfaces are not forced to implement unnecessary methods.
- This segregation allows for more modular, maintainable, and scalable design.

## üöÄ Applying ISP

Before ISP: Implementing the IModernMachine interface required unnecessary method implementations.
After ISP: The introduction of IPrint, IScan, IFax allows classes to implement only the functionalities they require.

## üìö Conclusion

Adhering to ISP enhances the modularity and maintainability of software designs. It ensures that classes have only the most relevant methods they need, promoting cleaner and more efficient codebases.
